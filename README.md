# Unsupervised Clustering of Stocks
Associative movements in stock prices are referred to as **sympathy plays**, which typically occur when a company’s stock is indirectly affected by another company’s stock or news. Sympathy plays may drive another stock, a group of stocks, or possibly an entire sector in a particular direction as their trades gain momentum.

This research will explore **unsupervised clustering methods to group stocks in the medical specialties and pharmaceutical industries listed on NASDAQ** that exhibit similar patterns in hourly price movement as an empirical measure. The clusters may help day traders to narrow down stocks in a watchlist for a sympathy play strategy, or provide indication of similar stocks to avoid in a diversification strategy.
